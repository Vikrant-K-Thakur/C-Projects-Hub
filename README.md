# C Projects Hub

Welcome to my personal collection of C language projects! This repository includes a variety of C programs and mini-projects created to improve my programming skills and understand key concepts like memory management, data structures, algorithms, file handling, and more.

## What's Inside?
- Beginner-level practice programs
- Data structures and algorithm implementations
- Small utilities and games
- System-level and file I/O projects

Stay tuned as I keep adding new projects regularly.
